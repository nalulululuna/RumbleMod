# RumbleMod for Beat Saber
Modify the HitNote rumble parameters.

Don't expect too much, because you can't make the rumble stronger than the hardware specs.  
The strength values above 1.0 may only work in the OculusVR environment(*),  
but the combination of numbers changes how you feel the rumble, so try it out.

FYI. My current settings for Valve Index (running 90Hz).
- HitNote Strength: 0.50
- HitNote Duration: 0.15

With this setting, you can feel slightly stronger rumble than the original.

(*) OculusVR environment
- Using Oculus HMD
- Beat Saber downloaded from Oculus Store or SteamVR version running with "-vrmode oculus"
