![RumbleMod](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62907586/96944746-a8c6d980-1516-11eb-939f-e8f4d83a1d0b.jpg)

A Beat Saber mod to modify the rumble parameters on hitting a note, saber, wall and ui.

This mod allows you to set up the rumbles of notes and walls for each.  
When you're playing a wall map and there is a wall on the floor,  
the rumble of the saber touching the floor can be disturbing,  
since you can't distinguish it from the rumble of cutting the notes.  
In this cases, you can solve the problem by reducing the rumble of the walls to zero.

You can't make the rumble stronger than the hardware specs,  
but the combination of numbers changes how you feel the rumble, so try it out.

For example, the following is my settings for Valve Index (90Hz).  
With these, I can feel slightly stronger rumble than the original.  
- Note Strength: 0.55
- Note Duration: 0.16

This mod just calls a generic API, so there shouldn't be any problems,  
but I don't take any responsibility for any trouble. **Use at you own risk**.

(*) Since Beat Saber v1.12, the strength value above 1.0 is no longer useful.  
So I lowered the maximum value from 3.0 to 1.0.
