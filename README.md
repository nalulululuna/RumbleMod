# RumbleMod for BeatSaber
Modify the HitNote rumble parameters.

Don't expect too much, because you can't make the rumble stronger than the hardware specs.  
The largest number of strength does not necessarily mean the largest rumble.
  
FYI. My current settings for Valve Index.
- Rumble Strength: 0.50
- Rumble Duration: 0.25

You can feel the rumble more than the original even if the strength value is less than the original.
