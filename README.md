# RumbleMod for Beat Saber
![RumbleMod](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62907586/78209936-7d7d8e00-74e3-11ea-909f-555895f2ee8c.jpg)

A Beat Saber mod to modify the rumble parameters on hitting a note, saber, wall and ui.

Don't expect too much, because you can't make the rumble stronger than the hardware specs.  
The strength values above 1.0 may only work in the OculusVR environment(*),  
but the combination of numbers changes how you feel the rumble, so try it out.

For example, the following is my settings for Valve Index (90Hz).  
With these, I can feel slightly stronger rumble than the original.
- Note Strength: 0.55
- Note Duration: 0.16

This mod just calls a generic API, so there shouldn't be any problems,  
but I don't take any responsibility for any trouble. **Use at you own risk**.

(*) The OculusVR environment is one that uses an Oculus HMD and meets one of the following conditions.
- The base game is Oculus Store version
- Steam version running with a launch option "-vrmode oculus"
